# 01 HTML CSS GIT CODE REFACTOR CHALLENGE

## Description 

In this refactor challenge we we're given the task of improving the codebase of the Herison Website to ensure it follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines. 

I changed the elements so that they were using more semantic elements rather than all div elements. This is to give a clearer understanding of what the elements are e.g. article, main, nav, header, aside, figure etc. I also updated the title to the name of the website and changed some of the heading attributes so they fall in a sequential order. For the image and icon elements I added accessible alt attributes to improve seo and improve the accessibility of the site. I also changed the class of some of the elements in order to group elements together that had the same CSS styling. This meant I was able to reduce the repetitveness of the CSS code.
